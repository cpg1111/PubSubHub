# PubSubHub
Universal PubSub

Currently a WIP.  The goal is to have a mq/pubsub that can talk over multiple protocols, currently tcp and websockets, soon adding udp. As well as be able to swap out its "engine" so that you can use either its native option, redis, zmq, rabbitmq, apache kafka or any other option contributors see fit.
